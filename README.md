# CNNPrimer

Repository for my [blog post](https://julienpascal.github.io/post/cnn/) on CNN using [Flux.jl](https://github.com/FluxML/Flux.jl)

## Credits
* The Julia code is heavily based on this Flux.jl [tutorial](https://github.com/FluxML/model-zoo/blob/master/vision/mnist/conv.jl). I only made minor modifications/removals for clarity and added the model's predicted values after training
